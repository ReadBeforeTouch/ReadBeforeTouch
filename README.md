w2i: whisper to interact! I'm probably afk or offtab and won't see your message otherwise.

dnc: do not copy! I usually don't put this as I think it should go without saying and is already under my boundaries list.

dni: do not interact! I might add further tags like "uc" (unless close) or "uf"(unless friends)

sys: this tag is used when an alter is fronting and are either using their faceclaim pony or want to be acknowledged or let others know they are an alter

**Other**

- We're autistic and a system. If you don't know what a system is and wish to know, scroll down past this section and I'll explain briefly.
- Boundaries and pronouns differ depending on the alter.
- Col. name changes often. Call us what you want or what we express at the time.
- Might need tone tags, especially if we don't really know you.
- Avoid using non-standard fonts, as well as voice messages.
- Don't hesitate to set clear boundaries, especially if you're a minor.
- We don't mind interacting w minors (14+) but we're unlikely to initiate the contact.

## Quick system info/FAQ

❔**What is a system?**


❔ **How do alters switch in real life and not just online?**

If an alter is "switching online," they are switching in real life. If applying this to ponytown, say Alter A is fronting, and then Alter B fronts, then the 2 alters are either cofronting, or Alter A left front and Alter B took their place. Alter B may or may not switch pony to better express the fact that they switched.

❔ **What's an introject?**

Introjects are alters that are formed with the identity from a person, object, or concept from something that is pre-existing. There are other terms for introjects, like introjects of real people, aka factives, and introjects of fictional characters, fictives. 
What they formed from is called a "source".

It should be noted that introjects are the brain's interpretation of their source. They are **not** the source itself. They're their own person, and should be treated as such. You **should not** obsess over an introject just because you like their source. They're not your favorite character. You also shouldn't hold them responsible for the actions of their source if their source happens to be problematic. (Unless they, as a person unrelated to being an introject, is problematic. It's called system responsibility)

Remember that this all is an extreme form of coping mechanism. No system chooses who and what they want their alters to be, and alters only form from stress/trauma. Some have abuser introjects who harm the system.

## **Common misconceptions**

❔ **Isn't this just roleplay?**

No! Being a system is *not* roleplay. The difference between being a system and roleplaying is incredibly obvious. Roleplaying is when you act as fictional characters in fictional scenarios for fun! It is a hobby. CDDs are when you have alters, practically other people in your head — not by choice nor for fun. 

❔**I would love to be a system, it seems so fun having friends/fictional characters in your head!**

There is so much wrong with this statement. Being a system is not fun. You can enjoy other alters in your system and other things about being a system, but that's *if you're a system*! As a singlet, you should not want to be a system. Being a system can come with arguments, miscommunications, completely forgetting big chunks of your life, never feeling comfortable in your own body and so much more. And regardless, it's not even a guarentee to have introjects, so saying you want fictional characters in your head isn't even completely a possibility. And most importantly, __all systems are formed from trauma.__ Being a system means you were traumatized as a young child. Being a system is not all fun and games.
